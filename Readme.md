### Load the Unpacked Extension

1. Click on **Load unpacked**.
2. Select the directory where you cloned or downloaded the extension files.

---

## Enabling Experimental Features

To use the AI Rewriter and AI Writer APIs, you need to enable experimental features and flags in Chrome.

---

### Enable Gemini Nano

ðŸ“£ *Ignore this section if you have already set up the Prompt API!*

#### Open Chrome Flags

Open a new tab in Chrome and navigate to:

```bash
chrome://flags/#optimization-guide-on-device-model
```

#### Enable Bypass Performance Requirement

1. Find **"On Device Model Optimization Guide"**.
2. Set it to **Enabled BypassPerfRequirement**.
3. This bypasses performance checks that might prevent Gemini Nano from being downloaded to your device.

#### Relaunch Chrome

Click on the **"Relaunch"** button that appears after changing the flag.

#### Confirm Availability of Gemini Nano

1. Open Developer Tools (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Go to the **Console** tab.
3. Enter the following command:

```javascript
(await ai.assistant.capabilities()).available;
```

If this returns **"readily"**, then you are all set.

---


#### Relaunch Chrome

Click on the **"Relaunch"** button that appears after changing each flag.

---

## Finalize the Setup

### Trigger Model Download

1. Open Developer Tools and go to the **Console** tab.
2. Enter the following command:

```javascript
await ai.writer.create();
```

Don't worry if the call fails; this forces Chrome to schedule a model download.

---

### Check Availability

1. Enter the following command:

```javascript
(await ai.assistant.capabilities()).available;
```

Repeat this command until the response changes to **"readily"**.

This may take about 3 to 5 minutes depending on your network connection, so let your Chrome instance run for a while.

# Using the Prompt API in Your Project

The Prompt API was a core component of my project, **Contextify**, as it enabled dynamic and efficient interaction with Chrome's built-in AI model, Gemini Nano. Here's a breakdown of how the Prompt API was used:

## Objective
The Prompt API was leveraged to modernize classic literary texts by:
- Simplifying archaic language for contemporary readers.
- Providing thematic explanations for educational purposes.
- Enhancing user interaction with AI-powered contextual tools.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Sentence Categorization
The Prompt API was used to analyze sentences within classic texts, classify them into predefined themes (e.g., History & Society, Literature & Art), and provide explanations:

- **Input:** Individual sentences extracted from the text.
- **Prompt:** 
    ```
    Classify the following sentence into one of the categories: 
    "History & Society," "Literature & Art," "Places & Spaces," "Performance & Expression," 
    "The Human Experience," or "The Creator's Lens." 
    Explain why the sentence fits that category.
    Sentence: [Input Sentence]
    ```
- **Output:** The category and a concise explanation of its relevance.

### 2. Rewriting Text for Modern Audiences
The Prompt API was instrumental in transforming complex and archaic language into clear, modern English:

- **Input:** Selected text from classic literature.
- **Prompt:** 
    ```
    Rewrite the following text in modern English, ensuring it remains engaging and accessible for contemporary readers. 
    Simplify archaic language, clarify complex ideas, and retain the original meaning.
    Text: [Input Text]
    ```
- **Output:** A simplified and modernized version of the text.

### 3. Explanations for Highlighted Text
Contextual explanations were generated for highlighted sections of the text, aiding readers in understanding its themes:

- **Input:** Highlighted text and the corresponding theme.
- **Prompt:** 
    ```
    You are an expert in the theme "[Theme Name]." 
    Explain how the following text aligns with this theme, providing clear and concise insights:
    Text: [Highlighted Text]
    ```
- **Output:** A detailed explanation linking the text to the theme.

### 4. Integration with Chrome Extension
The Prompt API was called directly from the Chrome extension using JavaScript and asynchronous API requests:
- The **input text** was sent to the Prompt API via a dedicated handler.
- **Real-time responses** from the API were displayed in modals or tooltips within the browser.

## Benefits of Using the Prompt API
- **Efficiency:** The API enabled rapid processing of complex text with high accuracy.
- **Flexibility:** Prompts could be tailored dynamically based on user interactions or selected themes.
- **Scalability:** The API seamlessly handled texts of varying lengths and complexities.
- **User Engagement:** By combining modernized language with contextual insights, it enriched the reader's experience.


## Troubleshooting

### Gemini Nano Not Available

1. Ensure you've followed all steps to enable the necessary Chrome flags.
2. Wait for at least 5 minutes after triggering the model download.
3. Keep Chrome running and avoid closing it during this time.
4. Check your internet connection, as the model download requires network access.

### AI APIs Not Available

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Chrome Canary, as experimental features may not be available in stable releases.
2. Verify that Experimental Web Platform features are enabled:
    - Navigate to:

```vbnet
chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features
```

    - Set it to **Enabled**.
    - Relaunch Chrome.

### Extension Not Working as Expected

1. Reload the extension from the `chrome://extensions/` page.
2. Check the Console in Developer Tools for any error messages.
3. Ensure all required permissions are included in **manifest.json**:

```json
"permissions": [
  "contextMenus",
  "scripting",
  "activeTab",
  "experimental"
]
```
